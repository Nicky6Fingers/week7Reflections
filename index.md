# Week 7 Reflections

## Re-read of Same Code

It is interesting that the ";" are not really needed for the code, one of nuances of javascript and also once again all of these extensions make life much easier.
The return statement exits out of the block of code and any thing after it in that block isn't excecuted.
const - is keyword used to store information you want to keep saved in memory and you can name this as well

## Re-Read the Eloquent JavaScript Example Codes

It all seems similar to while loops in my other programming classes, however the keyword "let" is new and interesting

## Eloquent JavaScript Reading

"The shiny or dull spot of a cd" interesting i didn't know it worked like this i thought it was similar to the old records where there are little "scratches" made into the disk

### Arithmetic info

**Numbers**- values are whole numeric values written in javascript like "15"
**fractional numbers**- written by using a dot "9.25"
**Scientific notation** = written as 2.998e8 with 8 being the exponent
**Maths**- Maths is done using operators such as "+" and "*" and follows the order of operations with % representing the remainder
**Special Numbers**- Infinity and -Infiinity as well as NaN (Not A Number) an example of this is dividing 0 by 0

### String Data Type

**Strings** are used to represent text and are written by typing into any of the different quote marks such as ""
**Escape Characters** when a \ is inside quoted text the next character has a special meaning and not simply to use the letter. (putting "\n" creates a new line while "\t" creates a tab)
**concatenate** - the "+" can be used to "glue" different strings together if you do need to do arithmetic it is possible using curly braces {}

### Boolean Type

**Boolean types** only have two values "yes" and " there is also no" or in other words "on" or "off", one of the ways it does this is by using things like the < and >  symbols to meet conditions to change it from the different values. There is also the == and != that is used for the same purpose.

### Logical Operators

**And** is denoted by &&
**Or** is denoted by ||
**Not** is written by a "!" similar to the != symbol
**Ternary** is denoted using three values it is shown by a ? and a colon

### Own Reflections

Most of this stuff i got a pretty good follow along of whats going on, the one thing that i guess threw me off was having stings as const, the way it had always been explained to me is you would only want to have a const that doesn't really change much (like a tax rate)
